        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p>Fascinated by technology from a young age, I tinkered with anything that I could get my hands on. Overtime, I have gained a wealth of experience when it comes to developing web and mobile applications. Although, I still feel I have a long way to go.</p>

        <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>Having worked on projects such as Breast Cancer Prediction, Anticipating Neural Response to a Stimulus and Mesh Segmentation using GCNNs, I can undoubtely say, that few things have fascinated me as much as giving a computer the ability to accurately predict and breakdown complex problems.</p>

      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="code-img" src="images/automation.webp" alt="code-img">

        <h3>Automation</h3>
        <p>I am big fan of automation and will often spend ludicrous amounts of time trying to automate a task that would take a few seconds. I just get a weird high when I see my bot automatically scraping the web for the best songs and then making me a playlist out of it.</p>

        <img class="chilli-img" src="images/racing.webp" alt="chillies-img">

        <h3>Racing</h3>
        <p>I honestly believe that my true skill lies in racing. Having beaten every one of my friends on every occasion, I do often wonder if I chose the wrong profession ü§î.</p>
