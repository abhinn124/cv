      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Engineering from New York University. I have previously worked at Udacity, SocialCops and Intellify. I ‚ù§Ô∏è Formula 1 and running.</p>

        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p>Fascinated by technology from a young age, I tinkered with anything that I could get my hands on. Overtime, I have gained a wealth of experience when it comes to developing web and mobile applications. Although, I still feel I have a long way to go.</p>

        <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>Having worked on projects such as Breast Cancer Prediction, Anticipating Neural Response to a Stimulus and Mesh Segmentation using GCNNs, I can undoubtely say, that few things have fascinated me as much as giving a computer the ability to accurately predict and breakdown complex problems.</p>

        <img class="code-img" src="images/automation.webp" alt="code-img">

        <h3>Automation</h3>
        <p>I am big fan of automation and will often spend ludicrous amounts of time trying to automate a task that would take a few seconds. I just get a very satisfying feeling when I see my bot automatically scraping the web for the best songs and then making me a playlist out of it.</p>

      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="chilli-img" src="images/racing.webp" alt="chillies-img">

        <h3>Racing</h3>
        <p>I honestly believe that my true skill lies in racing. Having beaten every one of my friends on every occasion, I do often wonder if I chose the wrong profession ü§î.</p>

        <img class="code-img" src="images/udacity.jpg" alt="code-img">

        <h3>Udacity</h3>
        <p>While at Udacity, I designed a sales data intelligence platform, built Information Retrieval system to turn scraped data into actionable insights, integrated payment gateway - Paddle, and built search engine using Elasticsearch.
I ensured maintenance of SDLC with planned object-oriented design processes, continuing with agile development, unit testing and following timely and smooth production deployment and improved customer experience. I also contributed in production and designing of new Nanodegree Programs such as Java Developer and Introduction to Machine Learning
I was also tasked with reviewing student projects across various Udacity Nanodegrees.</p>

        <h3>SocialCops</h3>
        <p>My job as a Data Scientist at one of India's foremost Data Intelligence and Gathering companies was a privilege. I worked with the Research and Analysis team on projects like - Analyzing trends in Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (for the Govt. of Maharashtra, India), Child Welfare Platform (for the‚Äã Child Investment Fund Foundation & Govt. of Rajasthan), SDG Solutions for (i) India (with UN India, MoSPI & NITI Aayog) and DISHA Dashboard (with MoRD & Gates Foundation)
I also helped create a search engine, which indexed open demographic data using Elasticsearch with a dynamic frontend to display results using Marionette.</p>
